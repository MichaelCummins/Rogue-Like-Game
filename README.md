## Why make this???

I started following gaming culture in my mid-teens and have loved how gaming as become the phenomenon it is today. I joined my alma mater's League of Legends competitive team and it was one of the highlights of my life being able to play on a stage in front hundreds of people. 

My ulimate goal in life is to help at least one person through gaming the way that it helped me growing up, with this game I hope that it is just the start of helping me accomplish my goal of creating something that people love.
